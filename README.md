# MinecraftModManager_
A basic Mod manager for Minecraft which handles installation of mods, as well as checking for updates and other cool stuff.

There's not a whole lot to write here right now since the program isn't finished.
If you want to add stuff to the program or have some feature suggestions then email me at samirichards100@gmail.com
